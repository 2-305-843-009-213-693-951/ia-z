# Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction
The first time that computer vision task was solved by using Artificial Neural Network was back in 1979 with the introduction of Neocognitron by Kunihiko Fukushima[[1]](#1). It was used for Japanese handwritten character recognition. It was inspired by the work of Hubel & Wiesel in 1959, where two type of cells were present in cats visual primary cortex which are simple cell and complex cell[[2]](#2). The simple cells called S-cells were responsible for extracting local features, and the complex cells called C-cells were responsible for the features' deformation, local shifts. The Convolutional Neural Network was introduced by Yann LeCun in 1989[[3]](#3) for the task of handwritten digital recognition.
