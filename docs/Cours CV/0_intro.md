# Computer Vision
As human we perceive the world using our eyes, by processing those signal in our brain to understand the world. Computer Vision is that task to percieve the world by a machine.
Today computer vision has evolved trememdously and it is used in several different industires. Back in the earlier days of 1970 it was believed that Computer Vision was the beginning to the Artificial General Intelligence. It was mainly dominated by hand crafted mathematical models. Fast forward to the present days, Computer Vision has outperformed the humans in many visual tasks. 

This is an introduction to the field of computer vision. We will cover the basics of computer vision, some of the milestones computer vision algorithms, and some of their applications.

## Contents
The following sections will cover the following topics:
1. Traditional Computer Vision
2. Learning based Computer Vision
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
4. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Modern Computer Vision tasks

## Some tasks in Computer Vision
This is not an exhaustive list of tasks.
- **Image classification**: the task to classify an image into one of the classes.
- **Object detection**: detection and/or localization of objects in an image.
- **Image segmentation**: the task to segment an image into different regions, based on the content of the image.
- **Image generation**: Such as generating images from texts, transfer the style of an image to another image, etc
- **Key points detection**: the task to detect the key points in an image.
- **3D Computer Vision**: Converting a set of 2D images into a 3D model, etc
